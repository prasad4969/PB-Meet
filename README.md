# PB-Meet

A Video Calling application.

## About the project

This Project is like Gmeet where we can organise a meeting on a particular date and time, And this application will notify you by sending email on the account by which you have logged in, to join the Meet and in the meeting there will be a chatting option, a whiteboard feature, screend recording, screen share,etc features for all the participants .
